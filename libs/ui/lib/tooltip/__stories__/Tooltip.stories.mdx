# Tooltip

Tooltip uses the [`react-popper`](https://popper.js.org/react-popper/v2/) library's `usePopper` hook.

<Canvas>
  <Story story={Default} />

<ArgsTable of={Tooltip} story="^" />

## Keyboard Support

Pressing `Escape` will close the tooltip.

## Accessibility

Determine whether the tooltip is used as one of the following:

- [primary label](https://inclusive-components.design/tooltips-toggletips/#tooltipasprimarylabel) For example, a bell icon that shows "Notifications" on hover is a primary label.
- [auxiliary descriptions](https://inclusive-components.design/tooltips-toggletips/#tooltipasauxiliarydescription). For example, a bell icon that shows "View notifications and manage settings" on hover is an auxiliary description. The tooltip content is supplementary, and the primary label of the bell icon is handled elsewhere.

The Tooltip component takes care of everything else.

## Design

Tooltips display additional information upon hover, or focus. The information should be contextual, useful, and nonessential.

A tooltip is a message box that is displayed when a user hovers over or gives focus to a UI element such as an icon, a highlighted word, or a button.

Tooltips are different from `alt` attributes, which are intended primarily for static images (`<img />`).

Tooltips fade in upon hover or touch of its trigger element. They fade out upon interacting with an area or element outside of the tooltip or its trigger, or on a delay of the cursor moving outside the tooltip or its trigger element.

### Placement

There are two variants of tooltips:

### 1. Basic tooltip

A basic tooltip is used to clarify the action or name of an interactive icon button.

#### Guidance

- The tooltip content should only contain one or two words.

#### Behavior

Icon tooltips are displayed on hover and focus.

#### Placement

By default, tooltips are placed on top of the referring element. When there isn’t enough space in the viewport, the tooltip is moved to the side or below as needed. If it blocks related content, the preferred tooltip placement can be manually set.

Tooltips should have no space (`0px`) between themselves and their target. They remain in place while the cursor moves within the target. Tooltips should never obscure the target element.

### 2. Definition tooltip

The definition tooltip provides additional help or defines an item or term. It may be used on the label of a UI element, or on a word embedded in a paragraph.

#### Guidance

- Should contain brief, read-only text
- Use on proper nouns, technical terms, or acronyms with two letters or more
- Do not use a definition tooltip on words with fewer than two letters

#### Behavior

Definition tooltips are displayed on hover and focus.

## Stories

### Variants

#### Definition

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Definition">
    <Tooltip
      isPrimaryLabel
      definition
      content="A brief definition of the underlined word above."
    >
      Definition tooltip
    </Tooltip>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

<span>
  In practice, a tooltip could also be rendered inside of a Text element’s{' '}
  <Tooltip content="Definition" definition>
    contents
  </Tooltip>
  .
</span>
