## Design

A radio input typically represents a single option in a group of related choices. Each radio input is boolean and only one can be selected at a time.

### Usage

Use radio inputs to present a set of options, where only one option can be selected at a time.
One radio input should be selected as the default choice by using the `checked` attribute.

#### Legends

Use a `fieldset` with `legend` (set in bold font weight and positioned above the group of radio inputs) to group a set of radio inputs. Some screen readers will announce the contents of the `legend` before each nested input to maintain context for a user.

#### Interaction

Users are able to select an option with click/tap on the radio button or its label.
Selecting one option unselects all others.
