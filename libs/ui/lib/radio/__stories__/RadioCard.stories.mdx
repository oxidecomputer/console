## Design

A radio input typically represents a single option in a group of related choices. Each radio input is boolean and only one can be selected at a time.

### Usage

One radio input should be selected as the default choice by using the `checked` attribute.

#### Labels and Help/Hint text

Radio input labels are set in regular font weight, positioned to the right of the element, and should be as short as possible.

Help/hint text can be added below the radio input label or as a paragraph below the group.

#### Interaction

Users are able to select an option with click/tap on the radio button or its label.
Selecting one option unselects all others.
