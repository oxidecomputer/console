# Table

This component is based off of the ARIA [Scrollable Data Grid example](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/examples/grid/dataGrids.html). It adds all the necessary ARIA attributes for you.

This component expects to handle relatively large data sets, so it relies on virtualization provided by the [`react-window` library](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-window).

<Canvas>
  <Story story={Default} />
</Canvas>

<ArgsTable of={Table} story="^" />

## Design

Tables display tabular data in a basic grid composed of cells, columns, and rows. This format makes it easy for users to scan and compare large amounts of data.

<Canvas>
  <Story story={DefaultWithControls} />
</Canvas>

### A single row

The table should render only one row.

</Canvas>

<Canvas>
  <Story story={SingleRowWithControls} />
</Canvas>
