# Style Utilities

These style utilities are a place to keep reused CSS to avoid duplication throughout the codebase. They can be style helper functions or CSS mixins. They should not have any visual design or an equivalent page in the Oxide Design System figma. They are here as a convenience for engineering.

## Screen Reader Only: `visuallyHiddenCss` or `<VisuallyHidden />`

In the cases where an element needs to be rendered, but does not have a corresponding visual design, (such as a `label` for an `input` element, or a `legend` for a `fieldset` element), import the css (`visuallyHiddenCss`) or a styled element (`<VisuallyHidden />`) to render these elements for screen readers following best accessibility practices.

**Note:** The `display: none;` CSS will hide the element from the screenreader. Do not use this CSS if the intention is to only hide the element from sighted users.
