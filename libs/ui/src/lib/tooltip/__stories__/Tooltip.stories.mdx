# Tooltip

Tooltip uses [the official Tippy.js component package, @tippyjs/react](https://github.com/atomiks/tippyjs-react).

<Canvas>
  <Story story={Default} />
</Canvas>

<ArgsTable of={Tooltip} story="^" />

## Accessibility

For accessibility, the `@tippjys/react` package automatically adds the `aria-describedby` attribute to the trigger (`<button>`) to associate it with the Tooltip content, which means these tooltips should act as [auxiliary descriptions](https://inclusive-components.design/tooltips-toggletips/#tooltipasauxiliarydescription), **not** [primary labels](https://inclusive-components.design/tooltips-toggletips/#tooltipasprimarylabel).

## Design

Tooltips display additional information upon hover, or focus. The information should be contextual, useful, and nonessential.

A tooltip is a message box that is displayed when a user hovers over or gives focus to a UI element such as an icon, a highlighted word, or a button.

Tooltips are different from `alt` attributes, which are intended primarily for static images (`<img />`).

Tooltips fade in upon hover or touch of its trigger element. They fade out upon interacting with an area or element outside of the tooltip or its trigger, or on a delay of the cursor moving outside the tooltip or its trigger element.

### Placement

There are two variants of tooltips:

### 1. Basic tooltip

A basic tooltip is used to clarify the action or name of an interactive icon button.

#### Guidance

- The tooltip content should only contain one or two words.

#### Behavior

Icon tooltips are displayed on hover and focus.

#### Placement

By default, tooltips are placed on top of the referring element. When there isnâ€™t enough space in the viewport, the tooltip is moved to the side or below as needed. If it blocks related content, the preferred tooltip placement can be manually set.

Tooltips should have no space (`0px`) between themselves and their target. They remain in place while the cursor moves within the target. Tooltips should never obscure the target element.

### 2. Definition tooltip

The definition tooltip provides additional help or defines an item or term. It may be used on the label of a UI element, or on a word embedded in a paragraph.

#### Guidance

- Should contain brief, read-only text
- Use on proper nouns, technical terms, or acronyms with two letters or more
- Do not use a definition tooltip on words with fewer than two letters

#### Behavior

Definition tooltips are displayed on hover and focus.
