# Number Field

This is a controlled component.

**Note** There are often unexpected behaviors using an input
of type `number`, as it includes built-in validation to reject non-numerical entries,
such as dashes and spaces (that are commonly found in phone numbers and credit card
numbers), whereas `e` (expotential usage as seen in a scientific calculator) pass the validation.

Do **not** use this field for those use cases, instead use `TextField`.
