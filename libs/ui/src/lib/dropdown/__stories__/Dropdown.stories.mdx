# Dropdown

The Dropdown component uses the [`useSelect`](https://github.com/downshift-js/downshift/tree/master/src/hooks/useSelect) hook from the [downshift.js library](https://www.downshift-js.com/).

  <Story story={Default} />

## Design

Dropdowns present a list of options from which a user can select one option, or several. A selected option can represent a value in a form, or can be used as an action to filter or sort existing content.

Ultimately there will be 3 variants:

- Dropdown: Allows the user to select one option from a list.
- Multiselect: Allows the user to select multiple options from a list and filter.
- Combo box: Allows the user to make a selection from a list of suggested, likely, or desired values.

### When to use

Dropdowns can be used in forms on full pages, in modals, or on side panels. The dropdown component is used to filter or sort contents on a page. It is a stylized version of the select component, and can be styled as needed.

### When not to use

It is best practice not to use a dropdown if there are two options to choose from. In this case, use a radio button group instead.

Do not nest dropdowns or use them to display overly complex information. Keep option selections as straight forward as possible.

Consider using a select dropdown if most of your experience is form-based or frequently used on mobile platforms. The native select works more easily with a native form when submitting data and is also easier to use on a mobile platform.
