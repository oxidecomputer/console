/**
 * Bind a keyboard shortcut with [Mousetrap](https://craig.is/killing/mice).
 * Neither `fn` nor `key` needs to be memoized. If `global`, use
 * `mousetrap-global-bind` to capture key presses from anywhere, including
 * inside textarea/input fields.

 * The `fnRef` trick is to avoid having to memoize the callback in the caller.
 * The keybind effect only runs when the key itself changes, i.e., never. See
 * Dan Abramov's post:
 * https://overreacted.io/making-setinterval-declarative-with-react-hooks/
