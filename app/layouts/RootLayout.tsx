/**
 * Loading bar for top-level navigations. When a nav first starts, the bar zooms
 * from 0 to A quickly and then more slowly grows from A to B. The idea is that
 * the actual fetching should almost always complete while the bar is between A
 * and B. The animation from 0 to A to B is represented by the `loading` label.
 * Then once we're done fetching, we switch to the `done` animation from B to
 * 100.
 *
 * **Important:** we only do any of this if the navigation takes longer than
 * `LOADING_BAR_DELAY_MS`. This prevents us from showing the loading bar on navs
 * that are instantaneous, like opening a create form. Sometimes normal page
 * navs are also instantaneous due to caching.
