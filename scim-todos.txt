- Will need to make pagination simiar to other pseudo-paginated endpoints, like https://github.com/oxidecomputer/omicron/blob/d74f5e3f1ae0a378dcdb9795a0ada2426702b046/nexus/src/external_api/http_entrypoints.rs#L5392
- Is dynamic copy (both / all 6) on Delete All message too much?
- Name attribute is in designs and might get added to API at some point, but not present yet.
