- Ask about 'name' column / attribute; not present in API, but was present in designs; are we expecting a name attribute?
- Note that the API doesn't currently accept a body for scimTokenCreate, and so we don't have a way to pass in the time_expires datetime
- Is dynamic copy (both / all 6) on Delete All message too much?
