# Web console project status and open source

We've made the console repo public because we prefer to work in the open, but we
are a small team at a small company narrowly focused on our customers. You're
welcome to send PRs, and if we have time, or if the PRs are very small or fix
bugs, we may be able to review and merge them. But be aware that we might not
get to it for a while, by which time it might no longer be relevant. If you want
to ask about whether a PR is consistent with our plans _before_ you put in the
work — and you should! — feel free to ask on the relevant issue.
