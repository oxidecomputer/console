# Console

Web client to the [Oxide control plane API](https://github.com/oxidecomputer/omicron).

## Tech

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) (+ [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/), [React Query](https://react-query.tanstack.com), [React Table](https://react-table.tanstack.com))
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) + [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/)
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech/) (generates typed API client from Nexus's [OpenAPI spec](app/docs/nexus-openapi.json))
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) (see main branch Storybook [here](https://console-ui-storybook.vercel.app/))

## Directory structure

The app is in [`app`](app). You can see the route structure in [`app/app.tsx`](app/app.tsx). In [`libs`](libs) we have a [`ui`](libs/ui) dir where the low-level components live (and the Storybook definition) and an [`api`](libs/api) dir where we keep the generated API client and a React Query wrapper for it. These directories are aliased in [`tsconfig.json`](tsconfig.json) for easy import from the main app as `@oxide/ui` and `@oxide/api`, respectively.

## Try it

The console is automatically deployed to GCP for testing purposes. It uses the real API, but the underlying systems are simulated as in local dev, so, e.g., while you can create "instances" (CockroachDB rows representing instances), they are not instantiated as running VMs. [Set up Tailscale](https://github.com/oxidecomputer/meta/blob/master/general/vpn.md) and go to https://console-git-main.internal.oxide.computer to see the main branch. PRs are deployed to `console-git-<branch_name>.internal.oxide.computer`.

The deployed instance includes a very barebones API docs page powered by [Redoc](https://github.com/Redocly/redoc). See it [here](https://console-git-main.internal.oxide.computer/docs/).

## Development

### Install dependencies

```
yarn install
```

### Run Storybook

```
yarn storybook
```

This will start the storybook for the `ui` component library and start it on `http://localhost:4400`.

### Run dev server

Run `yarn start` and navigate to http://localhost:4000/. The app will automatically reload if you change code. In order for this to work, you need to run the API as well.

### Run API

Clone [omicron](https://github.com/oxidecomputer/omicron) in the same parent directory as the console and install [rustup](https://rustup.rs/). Then:

```
rustup install stable  # install Rust
cargo build  # needs to be run in the omicron directory
npm i -g json
brew install tmux cockroachdb/tap/cockroach
```

The easy way to run everything is to use the `tools/start_api.sh` script, which uses tmux to run multiple processes in different panes and automatically populates some fake data (see `tools/populate_omicron_data.sh` to see exactly what). From the omicron directory, run `tools/start_api.sh`. Since we're assuming `console` and `omicron` are next to each other, that looks like this:

```sh
../console/tools/start_api.sh
```

To stop the API run `tools/stop_api.sh` (which kills the tmux session) or kill the tmux session manually.

<summary>Configuring tmux</summary

Because running the API requires running two programs plus the populate data script, we use tmux to split the terminal into panes so we can see the log output of all three. tmux has its own complicated set of [keyboard shortcuts](https://tmuxcheatsheet.com/). A good way to avoid having to deal with that if you want to poke around in the server logs is to create `~/.tmux.conf` that looks like this:

```
set -g mouse on
```

This will let you click to focus a pane and scrolling output with the mouse will automatically work. If you do want to use the shortcuts, here's a `tmux.conf` to make it a little more vim-like:

```shell
# change leader key from ctrl-b to ctrl-a
unbind C-b
set-option -g prefix C-a
bind-key C-a send-prefix

# ctrl-a v makes a vertical split, ctrl-a h make a horizontal split
bind v split-window -h
bind s split-window -v
unbind '"'
unbind %

# ctrl-a h/j/k/l move between panes
bind h select-pane -L
bind j select-pane -D
bind k select-pane -U
bind l select-pane -R

set -g mouse on
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Running without tmux</summary>

Using the script is strongly recommended, but if you really don't want to, make sure you've done the above setup andÂ then run the commands in `tools/start_api.sh` in separate terminal windows in the same order they are run in that script. Note the dependencies indicated by the `wait_for_up` commands.

| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `yarn test` | Jest tests. Takes Jest flags like `--onlyChanged` or `--watch`   |
| `yarn lint` | ESLint                                                           |
| `yarn tsc`  | Check types                                                      |
| `yarn ci`   | Lint, tests, and types                                           |
| `yarn fmt`  | Format everything. Rarely necessary thanks to editor integration |
| `yarn gen`  | Generate components, stories, tests, etc                         |
