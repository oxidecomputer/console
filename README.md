# Oxide - Console

This project was generated using [Nx](https://nx.dev).

## Getting Started

### Starting storybook

```console
$ yarn storybook
```

This will start the storybook for the `ui` component library and start it on `http://localhost:4400`.

### Creating a new component

```console
$ yarn g:ui-component <COMPONENT_NAME> [--skipStories]
```

Where `<COMPONENT_NAME>` is the name of the new component to include. If you don't want a storybook story as well; pass `--skipStories`

## Adding capabilities to your workspace

Nx supports many plugins which add capabilities for developing different types of applications and different tools.

These capabilities include generating applications, libraries, etc as well as the devtools to test, and build projects as well.

Below are our core plugins:

- [React](https://reactjs.org)
  - `yarn add -D @nrwl/react`
- Web (no framework frontends)
  - `yarn add -D @nrwl/web`
- [Angular](https://angular.io)
  - `yarn add -D @nrwl/angular`
- [Nest](https://nestjs.com)
  - `yarn add -D @nrwl/nest`
- [Express](https://expressjs.com)
  - `yarn add -D @nrwl/express`
- [Node](https://nodejs.org)
  - `yarn add -D @nrwl/node`

There are also many [community plugins](https://nx.dev/nx-community) you could add.

## Generate an application

Run `nx g @nrwl/react:app my-app` to generate an application.

> You can use any of the plugins above to generate applications as well.

When using Nx, you can create multiple applications and libraries in the same workspace.

## Generate a library

Run `nx g @nrwl/react:lib my-lib` to generate a library.

> You can also use any of the plugins above to generate libraries as well.

Libraries are shareable across libraries and applications. They can be imported from `@oxide/mylib`.

## Development server

Run `nx serve web-console` for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `nx g @nrwl/react:component my-component --project=ui` to generate a new component. Most new components should go into the `ui` package

## Build

Run `nx build my-app` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `nx test my-app` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io).

Run `nx affected:test` to execute the unit tests affected by a change.

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e my-app` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io).

Run `nx affected:e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests affected by a change.

## Understand your workspace

Run `nx dep-graph` to see a diagram of the dependencies of your projects.
