 * response for an ephemeral IP does not indicate the instance it's attached to
 * (maybe it should, but that's a separate problem), but we need the instance ID
 * on each one in order to look up the IPs for a given instance. The floating IP
 * arm of the union does have an instance_id field, so that's a point in favor
 * of adding it to the ephemeral IP arm.
